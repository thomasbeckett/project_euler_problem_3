Find the largest prime factor of a number

Initially tried iterate over each number up to half of the given number and checks to see if it it a factor. Then checks if each factor given is a prime and puts the prime factors into an array. This works for smaller numbers but runs for a long time when larger numbers are entered.

The final working solution utilises the Prime class which finds the prime factors of a number and returns an array.
